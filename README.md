# Safe Multi-Agent Poker with GTO Exploitation

## Motivation

Most poker AIs — such as PioSOLVER — focus on heads-up GTO convergence.  This project moves beyond GTO solvers by applying multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to model adaptive, exploitative play in multi-player settings, aiming for +3 BB/100 EV against near-GTO opponents.

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run training (recommended test run first)
python training/train_exploitative.py \
  --n_players 3 \
  --max_episodes 100 \
  --eval_interval 50 \
  --eval_hands 100 \
  --target_ev 2.0

# Analyze results
# Training logs and action CSVs are stored in logs/
```

##  Future Directions

### 1. **JAX Integration**
- Migrate from PyTorch to JAX for improved computational efficiency
- Leverage hardware acceleration (GPU/TPU) and automatic differentiation
- Reduce training time through optimized tensor operations
- Enable larger-scale multi-agent experiments

### 2. **Representation Learning**
- Deep feature extraction from poker game states
- Advanced information abstraction for hand ranges


### 3. **Extended Game Types**
- Support for different poker variants (Hold'em, Omaha, Stud)
- Variable player counts (2-10 players) and stack sizes
- Tournament structures and ICM (Independent Chip Model) considerations
- Multi-table tournament (MTT) scenarios
- Cash game vs tournament dynamics

### 4. **Toward Realistic Competitive Environments**
Model elite tournaments (e.g., Triton London) where most participants adhere to near-GTO strategies, enabling the study of adaptive counter-strategies and meta-level reasoning in realistic high-stakes settings.
